        <p>This is a page all about how my code got flipped turned upside down it will take me just a minute just sit real still, ill  tell you how my code became the king of github.
        In the NorthWest of Calgary born and raised, On the playground is where I spent most of my days, Chilling out, stacking, relaxing all cool,And all gaming some pokemon outside of the school
        When a couple of guys who were up to no good, Started stealing games in my neighborhood,I got in one little battle and my mom got scared,And said "You're only gaming with your brother and your father at home"
        I begged and pleaded with her day after day,But she hid my games and sent me on my way,She gave me some homework and then she gave me some food,I put my Walkman on and said "I might as well live it"
        First class, yo, this is bad,Drinking apple juice out of a champagne glass,Is this what the people who get favorited are like?, Hmmm, this might be all right, But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that,
        Is this the type of place that they should sent this fly fox?,I don't think so, I'll see when grow up,I hope they're prepared for the king of comics,Well, uh, the time has passed and when I came out,There was a dude looked like a joke standing there with my name out,
        I ain't looking for no trouble yet, I just got here,I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared,I ran for a bus and when it came near,The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror,If anything I could say that this bus was rare,But I thought
        "Nah, forget it, yo holmes, to the lake!",I pulled up to my house about seven or eight,And I yelled to the bus driver "Yo holmes, thanks alot",Looked at my castle, I was finally there,To sit on my throne as the king of comics.</p>
